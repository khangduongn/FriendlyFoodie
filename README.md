# FriendlyFoodie
Friendly Foodie is a recipes and pantry organizer web application that provides an easy way for users to keep track of the ingredients available in their kitchen as well as get recipe ideas based on the available ingredients. The app also has a shopping cart feature that lets users add and keep track of ingredients that they would like to purchase at the grocery store. For low stock ingredients, the app will automatically add these ingredients to the shopping cart to remind users to purchase them if needed.
