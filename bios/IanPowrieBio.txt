My name is Ian Powrie, I am a first year Data science student. I am new to GitLab, and the coding experience.

I have some experience with CLIs, but I am still overall fairly new to them. I am a first year data science major. 

I chose Drexel because of the Co-op opportunities

CI102 is the hardest class for me so far.
